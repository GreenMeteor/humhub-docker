# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow checks out code, runs tests, generates a coverage report,
# performs a Codacy security scan, and integrates the results with GitHub
# Advanced Security for code scanning. For more information on the Codacy
# security scan action usage and parameters, see
# https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter-action.
# For more information on Codacy Analysis CLI in general, see
